          <h2>Something about Refrigerators</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Refrigerators are an essential appliance in modern households,
              providing a convenient and efficient way to store perishable food
              items and beverages at optimal temperatures. Available in a wide
              array of sizes, styles, and functionalities, refrigerators cater
              to various needs and preferences of homeowners. The most common
              types include top-freezer, bottom-freezer, side-by-side, and
              French door models. Advances in technology have led to the
              development of smart refrigerators, which offer additional
              features such as touchscreen interfaces, Wi-Fi connectivity, and
              smartphone integration, allowing users to remotely monitor and
              control their refrigerators.

          <div class="hide">
            <p>
              Energy efficiency is a crucial factor to consider when purchasing
              a refrigerator, as it directly impacts both the environment and
              household utility bills. Modern refrigerators are designed to
              consume less energy than older models, with many being Energy Star
              certified. Energy Star certified refrigerators use at least 15%
              less energy than the minimum federal efficiency standard,
              resulting in significant cost savings for homeowners over time.
              When selecting a refrigerator, it is essential to consider factors
              such as size, capacity, and usage habits to ensure that the chosen
              model offers optimal energy efficiency without compromising
              performance and convenience.
